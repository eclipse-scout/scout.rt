/**
 * Use this adapter to work with UTC <code>xsd:dateTime</code>s. A UTC time is also known as 'zulu' time, and has
 * 'GMT+-00:00'.
 * <p>
 * This adapter converts <code>xsd:dateTime</code> into UTC milliseconds, by respecting the timezone as provided. If the
 * timezone is missing, the date is interpreted as UTC-time, and not local to the default JVM timezone. To convert a
 * {@link Date} into <code>xsd:dateTime</code>, the date's milliseconds are used as UTC milliseconds from the epoch, and
 * are formatted as 'zulu' time.
 * <p>
 * The {@link String} provided must correspond to the <code>xsd:dateTime</code> format defined on
 * <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime">http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime</a>. The format was
 * inspired by [ISO 8601] but with timezone information included, because in [ISO 8601], a time is only represented as
 * local time or in relation to UTC (Zulu time).
 * <p>
 * <b> Please note, that if there is a timezone present, this adapter transforms the date into the UTC time. To get the
 * local time in that timezone, the timezone shift has to be added to the date. </b>
 * <p>
 * In the following, the rules of conversion to an UTC time are explained:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If there is a timezone included, the resulting {@link Date} would represent the UTC time, not the local time. To
 * get the local time in that timezone, the timezone shift has to be added to the UTC date. If you are expecting dates
 * from within different timezones, this adapter might not be suitable because the timeshift portion is lost which makes
 * it impossible to derive the local time.</li>
 * <li>If an UTC time is provided (dennoted by a 'Z', +00:00 or -00:00 as its timezone), the date is interpreted as UTC
 * time</li>
 * <li><b>If there is no time zone provided, the date is interpreted to be 'zulu' time, and not as a date in JVM default
 * timezone</b></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In the following, please find some examples of the conversion from <code>xsd:date</code> to the UTC {@link Date}.
 * <table border="1">
 * <tr>
 * <th><code>xsd:date</code></th>
 * <th>UTC date</th>
 * <th>Description</th>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>2011-11-03T18:04:00-05:00</td>
 * <td>2011-11-03 23:04:00</td>
 * <td>The date provided represents a local time in the given timezone whereas the resulting date is an UTC date.</td>

 * <tr>
 * <td>2011-11-03T18:04:00Z</td>
 * <td>2011-11-03 18:04:00</td>
 * <td>The date provided is already an UTC date and therefore is the same as the resulting UTC {@link Date}</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>2011-11-03T18:04:00</td>
 * <td>e.g. 2011-11-03 17:04:00, if timezone is <code>+01:00</code></td>
 * <td>The date provided has no timezone information included and therefore is interpreted to be a local date in respect
 * to the default timezone of this JVM. Depending on the default timezone, the resulting UTC date differs.</td>
