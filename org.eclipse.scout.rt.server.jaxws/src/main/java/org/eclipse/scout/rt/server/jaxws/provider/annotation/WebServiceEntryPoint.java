/**
 * Use this annotation to generate an <em>entry point port type</em> for an <em>endpoint interface</em>. Like the
 * implementing port type, an entry point implements all methods of the endpoint interface, and is to be published
 * instead of the implementing port type. However, the entry point simply intercepts webservice requests, but does not
 * answer them, which is still done by the implementing port type. Finally, the implementing port type is looked up as a
 * bean, and must implement the endpoint interface.
 * <p>
 * The entry point ensures the request to run in a {@link RunContext}, and optionally enforces authentication. Following
 * this, the request is propagated to the implementing port type.
 * <p>
 * Any sibling annotation is added to the entry point as well. That also applies for {@link WebService} annotation to
 * overwrite values as declared in the WSDL file. If you provide an explicit <em>handler chain binding file</em>,
 * handlers and authentication as declared with this annotation are ignored.
 * <p>
 * The generation of the <em>entry point port type</em> is done during compile-time. In short, APT is used to spider for
 * {@link WebServiceEntryPoint} annotations. Then, for each annotation found, an <em>entry point port type</em>
 * according to the annotation's specification is generated.
 * <p>
 * The binding to the concrete endpoint is done via {@link #endpointInterface()} attribute. If a WSDL declares multiple
 * services, create a separate <em>entry point definition</em> for each service to be published.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Example usage:</strong>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;WebServiceEntryPoint(
 *     endpointInterface = PingWebServicePortType.class,
 *     entryPointName = "PingWebServiceEntryPoint",
 *     entryPointPackage = "org.eclipse.ws.ping",
 *     serviceName = "PingWebService",
 *     portName = "PingWebServicePort",
 *     handlerChain = {
 *         &#64;Handler(@Clazz(LogHandler.class)),
 *         &#64;Handler(value = @Clazz(IPAddressFilter.class) , initParams = {
 *             &#64;InitParam(key = "rangeFrom", value = "192.200.0.0"),
 *             &#64;InitParam(key = " rangeTo", value = "192.255.0.0")})
 *     },
 *     authentication = @Authentication(
 *         method = @Clazz(BasicAuthenticationMethod.class) ,
 *         verifier = @Clazz(ConfigFileCredentialVerifier.class) ) )
 * </pre>
