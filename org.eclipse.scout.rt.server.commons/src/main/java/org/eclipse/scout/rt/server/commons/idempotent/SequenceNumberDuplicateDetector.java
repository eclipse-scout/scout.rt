/**
 * Data structure that detects duplicates on a series of sequence numbers as it is used with non-idempotent http post
 * communications. The request sequence numbers arrive in <em>almost</em> ascending order. This means that the incoming
 * numbers must not be perfectly ascending but more or less; some numbers bypassing others within the network latency
 * time. Such bypassing can happen when multiple parallel http requests rush the server.
 * <p>
 * Therefore the {@link SequenceNumberDuplicateDetectorEx} keeps in mind the sequence numbers of the last few minutes
 * (DT). That way it can safely decide if an incoming sequence number is a duplicate or not.
 * <p>
 * The decision if a new incoming sequence number S is a duplicate is as follows
 * <ol>
 * <li>if the {@link SequenceNumberDuplicateDetectorEx} contains S in its cache of former N numbers, then S is rejected
 * as duplicate</li>
 * <li>else if S is lower than the lowest number in the cache of former N numbers, then S is rejected, since it is
 * definitely out of sequence</li>
 * <li>else S is added to the cache. If the cache is larger than cacheSize, then cache elements older than DT are
 * dropped until the cache has size cacheSize. S is finally accepted</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * This implementation is thread-safe.

   *          is the number of entries that the cache tries to maintain. The cache may become larger upon high request
   *          load but will later try to resize to this size. Typical values are in the range 25 to 1000.
   * @param maxAge
   *          is the time while sequence numbers remain cached. This value must be larger than the expected network
   *          latency or the expected backlog wait time.
   *          <p>
   *          Typical latency time is around 10-200ms thus a maxAge of 1-5 minutes is safe.
   *          <p>
   *          In addition the http client may have a backlog of waiting http calls. Thus a batch of 1000 calls may reach

   *          the client.

   *          smaller than the smallest key in the cached window then it is declared a potential duplicate.
