/**
 * Platform used by tests that require a global available platform.
 * <p>
 * Such test classes are annotated with <code>@RunWith(PlatformTestRunner.class)</code> or have a before statement with
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Before
 * public void before() {
 *   Platform.get().awaitPlatformStarted();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * It is important that tests using {@link Platform#get()} or {@link BEANS#get(Class)} kind of logic make sure that the
 * test waits until the platform is really started. Just calling {@link Platform#get()} only ensures that the platform
 * is in <i>Stating</i> state. Only calling {@link IPlatform#awaitPlatformStarted()} ensures that it is in
 * <i>Started</i> state.
 * <p>
 * This implementation of IPlatform that is used in testing environments and blocks the initializing thread until
 * {@link IPlatform#awaitPlatformStarted()}.
 * <p>
 * The initializing thread is the thread that first calls - directly or indirectly with BEANS.get - Platform.get and
 * that way triggered the platform startup.
