/**
 * Message oriented middleware (MOM) for sending and receiving messages between distributed systems.
 * <p>
 * This MOM provides publish/subscribe (topic-based) or point-to-point (queue-based) messaging. A topic allows to
 * publish a message to multiple subscribers, meaning that the message is transported to all consumers which currently
 * are subscribed. A queue differs from the topic distribution mechanism that the message is transported to exactly one
 * consumer. If there is no subscription the message will be kept until a consumer subscribes for the queue. However, if
 * there are multiple subscriptions for the queue, the message is load balanced to a single consumer.
 * <p>
 * Besides, this MOM provides 'request-reply' messaging, which is kind of synchronous communication between two parties.
 * The publisher of a message blocks until the reply is received. This mode is still based on P2P or pub/sub messaging,
 * meaning there is no open connection for the time of blocking.
 * <p>
 * Message addressing is based on destinations (queues or topics), which additionally allow to register for a
 * {@link IMarshaller}. A marshaller is used to transform the transfer object into its transport representation, like
 * text in JSON format, or bytes for the object's serialization data.
 * <p>
 * End-to-end security may be achieved by using a secure communication protocol, or by encrypting the messages in the
 * {@link IMarshaller}. However, if relying on a secure transport layer, messages may temporarily be stored in
 * clear-text like when being delivered to queues.
