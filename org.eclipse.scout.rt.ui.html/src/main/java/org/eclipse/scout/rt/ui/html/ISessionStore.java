/**
 * Per-HTTP-session store for {@link IUiSession}s and {@link IClientSession}s.
 * <p>
 * <b>About Serialization</b>
 * <p>
 * Currently, this class does not extend the {@link Serializable} interface. It can therefore be added as a session
 * attribute, but if the HTTP session is passivated or moved to another cluster node, it will not work. There is no
 * solution for this problem at the moment. Even when this class was serializable, its content would not be
 * (ClientSession, UiSession, HttpSession). Serializing an empty SessionStore object would not be any better.
 * <p>
 * Once there is a solution for serializing {@link IClientSession} (including all forms, outlines etc.), this decision
 * may be re-thought. See also the related <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=458145">Scout bug
 * 458145</a>.
