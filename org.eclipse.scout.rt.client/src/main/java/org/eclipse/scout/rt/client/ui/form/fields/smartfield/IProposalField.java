 * A proposal field provides two functions:
 * <ol>
 * <li>choose a proposal from a list of proposals (like smart-field), or...
 * <li>enter a custom text that does or does not exist in the list of proposals
 * </ol>
 * The value of a proposal field is always of type String. If a user coincidentally enters a text which also exists in
 * the proposal list, only the text is set and the lookupRow property is not s set. If a user has selected a proposal
 * from the proposal list the lookupRow property is set. That's how you can distinct between manually entered texts and
 * proposals chosen from the list.
 * <p>
 * There's no validation logic that checks for duplicates between manually entered text and the proposal list.
