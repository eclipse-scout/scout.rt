Since model-based selection filtering leads to many defects and misunderstandings. See ticket 87693 and others (follow).
removed ITable.acceptSelection and AbstractTable.execAcceptSelection
removed ITree.acceptSelection and AbstractTree.execAcceptSelection
removed AbstractListBox.execAcceptSelection
removed AbstractTreeBox.execAcceptSelection
old:
      @Override
      protected boolean execAcceptSelection(ITreeNode node, Long value, int level) {
        return level >= 2;
      }
new:
      @Override
      protected void execFilterNewNode(ITreeNode newNode, int level) throws ProcessingException {
        newNode.setEnabled(level >= 2);
      }

14.07.2010 imo
Disabled rows on ITable and disabled nodes on ITree are (now) selectable, and support for context menus.

14.07.2010 imo
Changed model of listbox and treebox. The value (checked keys) is separated from the selection (table selection)
The (existing) checkable property is used to distinguish between listboxes with checkboxes and listboxes that behave like tables.
On checkable listboxes (normally multi-selection boxes) selecting a row is NOT the same as checking the rows checkbox.
On non-checkable listboxes (normally single-selection boxes) selecting a row is the same as checking the corresponding key.
renamed getConfiguredFilterSelectedRows to getConfiguredFilterCheckedRows
added ITableRow.isChecked
added ITableRow.setChecked
added ITreeNode.isChecked
added ITreeNode.setChecked
renamed all IListBox.*Select* to IListBox.*Check*
renamed all ITreeBox.*Select* to ITreeBox.*Check*
Migration:
Check all occurrences of ITable.setMultiSelect(true/false) and check if it is a listbox table.
Most such cases are replaced by ITable.setMultiCheck(true/false), except those where the listbox was set to non-checkable
either by getConfiguredCheckable(){return false;} or by getMyListBox().getTable().setCheckable(false);

14.07.2010 imo
Removed the ITable.getContextRow since this is now the same as getSelectedRow()
Removed the ITree.getContextNode since this is now the same as getSelectedNode()

14.07.2010 imo
Removed AbstractAction/AbstractMenu.getConfiguredNonSelectionAction() since this is obsolete now that disabled rows can be selected.

15.07.2010 imo

new:
  protected void execRowClick(ITableRow row) throws ProcessingException {
    IColumn col=getContextColumn();

Change in field validation: Error status is set to WARN instead of ERROR when an invalid date is entered via date picker.
Affected Field Types: AbstractDateField, AbstractTimeField, AbstractDateTimeField

Problem:
Validation errors of text input in date fields lead to different results in the GUI than validation of date input (via date picker of keystrokes).
Invalid date input is not displayed in the text field whereas invalid text input is. In both cases an error icon is shown to indicate that the entered value is not valid.
In the case of date input, the date is not displayed in the text field, if it is invalid. When the field is re-validated and the previously entered value was valid, the field is valid again and the error disappears.
A user might not notice that his input value was not accepted, when working fast.

In both cases the model contains only valid values (as always) and an error status (IProcessingStatus.ERROR).

Solution:
If a date input is invalid, the error status is set to (IProcessingStatus.WARNING) to indicate that the selected value was not accepted, but there might still be a valid value in the text field.
The warn status only disappears, if a new date or text is entered.

This solution was chosen based on the following principles:
- The model should only contain valid values (as before)
- Text input should not be removed or changed when it is wrong (user experience).
- Date input should not be displayed in the text field, if invalid, because it may not be possible to format it and the date input may depend on the value in the model (keystrokes).

By default, table cells that are disabled should not be editable.
Migration: None

27.01.2011 dwi
Problem:
In SwingScoutTable#prepareRenderer, evaluation of cell's editable state to draw respective marker icon caused loops and UI freeze.
So far, the only way to determine cell's editable state was to call AbstractColumn#isCellEditable(ITableRow). This required synchronization with model thread which affected performance badly. Even worse, if model thread was busy, the enqueued request did not succeed at all (timeout).
Solution:
- Property added to hold result of AbstractColumn#isCellEditable(ITableRow) which can be evaluated in UI thread without need of model thread synchronization.
- Population of property: Property is populated when AbstractColumn#decorateCellInternal is called.
- Change of ICellSpecialization and implementing classes: added ICellSpecialization$isEditable(), added ICellSpecialization#setEditable(boolean)
- Change of ICell and implementing classes: added ICell#isEditable()) -> default value is false
- Change of Cell: added Cell#isEditable(), added Cell#setEditableInternal(boolean). Accessor setEditableInternal(boolean) is internal by intention as not intended for public use as various checks in AbstractColumn#execIsEditable are bypassed otherwise (JavaDoc added). E.g., do not use in execDecorateCell.
- Change of SwingTableModel#isCellEditable() --> synchronization with model thread not neccessary anymore as property can be evaluated thread safe. (Java bean property)
- Change of SwingScoutTable#prepareRenderer() --> synchronization with model thread for querying editable state not neccessary anymore as property can be evaluated thread safe. (Java bean property)

In SWT Perspective-Handling was never really thought through and tested with more than one perspective and/or more than one scout-application running parallel. This was now done, implemented and tested with Kudi/Bap. (see Visio)
In general can be said, that now no perspective has to be active/open to run a scout-application. When the Workbench is started the existing scout-application will be started and the model-desktop open. As soon as the perspective is active execGuiAttached will be called on the model-desktop. When the perspective is closed execGuiDettached is called. When a perspective is reset detached/attached is called.

Change in Scout-Client:
- Everywhere desktop.isGuiAvailable() was called now desktop.isOpened() is called. For Swing there is no change, the two states are changed at the same location.
- AbstractDesktop.closeInternal goes through all open forms and calls removeForm
- IDesktopUIFacade has now fireDesktopResetFromUI anymore. This method was used from AbstractSwtEnvironment
- new Property on IForm: PROP_PERSPECTIVE_ID. This is used from SWT to ensure a form is opend in a chosen perspective. No use in Swing.

Migration: Swing-Gui: none / SWT-Gui: if application uses more than one perspective, changes may be necessary. Please consult with me (s.leicht@bsiag.com / 947)

Problem:
Sometimes, not all calendar items supposed to be loaded into a calendar by an AbstractCalendarItemProvider (package org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.ui.basic.calendar.provider) are actually shown in the calendar due to race conditions.
Analysis:
During initialization of an AbstractCalendarItemProvider in its constructor, loadItemsAsyncInternal() is invoked twice:
- once via initConfig() -> setRefreshIntervalMillis()
- once via ensureItemsLoadedInternal()
If the asynchronous loading of the first invocation of loadItemsAsyncInternal() has not completed while the second invocation is taking place, the first invocation is canceled. However, the first invocation will try to reschedule another job. This will cause the second invocation to be canceled as well. If no m_minDateLoaded, m_maxDateLoaded were set yet, no other jobs are scheduled and the current instance will never provide any calendar items again.
Solution:
Rescheduling (and cancelling a currently running job) should only happen, if a previous job actually succeeded in loading the calendar items.
Migration: None

Bugzilla Ticket 331535

Added possibility to override/complete texts and translations defined by the scout framework.
To fully enable this feature, the following adaptations are necessary:

0) Add the additional translations and text overrides to the project specific text resources:
Adapt Texts_*.properties files in your scout project (com.example.myapp.shared/resources/texts) by adding
the same keys as defined by the scout framework (org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/resources/texts/ScoutTexts.properties)
with your own translations.

1) Override method getNlsTexts in ClientSession:

  @Override
  public DynamicNls getNlsTexts(){
    return Texts.getInstance();
  }

2) Override method getNlsTexts in ServerSession:

  @Override
  public DynamicNls getNlsTexts(){
    return Texts.getInstance();
  }

3) Only required for Swing client: override createSwingEnvironment() in class SwingApplication:
- set the global text provider for Swing with SwingUtility.setNlsTexts
- call execInitLocale() to initialize the NlsLocale as stored in the UserPreferences

  @Override
  protected ISwingEnvironment createSwingEnvironment(){
    execInitLocale();
    SwingUtility.setNlsTexts(Texts.getInstance());
    return new SwingEnvironment();

bsi ticket 102'010: ScoutInfoForm looks ugly (in SWT)
Problem:
a) ScoutInfoForm does not look nice in SWT
b) ... does not have a Default-Logo
c) ... has a quirky way of getting the logo.

Solution:
a) In Swing the GridData is different than for the other ui-layers.
b) The Bundle org.eclipse.scout.rt.client has now a Default-Logo.
c) The Logo is searched with th IconLocator.

Migration:
If ScoutInfoForm is overwritten to be able to get the correct logo this is not necessary anymore. Just the IIconProviderService
has to be registered and an Icon with the name application_logo_large.png must be in a bundle.

- Fixed layout problems when changing from non-edit to edit-mode (checkbox positioning)
- Added VerticalAlignment on IBoolean column to align the checkbox in both directions, vertical and horizontal
- Fixed problems in LogicalGridLayout manager to round resulting floating numbers (center position caluculations) the same way as Java layout managers do. Otherwise, the checkbox is positioned differently in between of the layout managers which causes the checkbox to jump around.

BSI ticket #105'026, #104'976
Problem:
- Failed to display corrupt HTML pages (e.g. if missing closing quote in style definition)
- In HTML editor, no cleanup (auto-correction) should be applied to the given HTML. That is because if the user did some modifications in the HTML source and reloads the HTML in the editor anew, unwanted auto-corrections would be applied.
Solution:
- Accomplish consistency concerning HTML styling (cleanup) in between of Swing and SWT in regard of ScoutHtmlField and ScoutHmtEditor.
  In more detail, this entails the following:
  - Before passing the HTML to the respective widget (ScoutHtmlEditor, ScoutHtmlField), Abstract[Swing|Swt]Environment#styleHtmlText() is called to cleanup the given HTML.
  - In case of HTML editor mode, no modifications are applied to the given HTML in both, Swing and SWT, respectively.
  - However, in non-editor mode, some intelligence is applied to the HTML to ensure proper display of the HTML document.
    - In Swing, cleanup of HTML structure and CSS definitions is done. That is crucial as Swing HTML viewer has some problems with some CSS constructs.
    - In SWT, OS default browser is used. That is why cleanup of CSS is not necessary as done by browser itself.
      But, because the HTML is provided as file to the browser, proper encoding and charset must be set.
- Failsafe: if HTML text cannot be parsed for cleanup, the raw HTML text is used instead of an exception thrown.
- Consolidation of HTML cleanup functionality in HTMLUtility for plain and simple use that is applicable for both, SWT and Swing, respectively. That is why various methods in HtmlUtility are removed.
Plug-Ins affected:
- org.eclipse.scout.commons (HTMLUtility
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.client (AbstractHtmlField)
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.swing (AbstractSwingEnvironment, SwingScoutHtmlField, SwingScoutMailField)
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.swing.bsi.fragment (SwingScoutHtmlEditor)
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.swt (AbstractSwtEnvironment, SwtScoutHtmlField)
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.swt.bsi.fragment (SwtScoutHtmlEditor)
Migration Swing / SWT:
- In HTMLUtility, the following methods are removed.
  - HTMLUtility#parseDocument(String) to be replaced by HTMLUtility.toHtmlDocument(String)
  - HTMLUtility#formatDocument(String) to be replaced by HTMLUtility.toHtmlText(HTMLDocument)
  - HTMLUtility#cleanupDocument(HTMLDocument, String, int) to be replaced by HTMLUtility.cleanupHtml(String, boolean,boolean, DefaultFont)
  - HTMLUtility#wellformDocument(HTMLDocument, String, int) to be replaced by HTMLUtility.cleanupHtml(String, boolean,boolean, DefaultFont)
Migration SWT:
- In AbstractSwtEnvironment, the following methods are removed as not required anymore because logic is encapsulated in HTMLUtility.
  - AbstractSwtEnvironment#styleHtmlText(Control, String)

BSI ticket #106'222, #99'582, #105'229
Bugzilla ticket #358064, #359811, #359812
Problem:
All the tickets mentioned belong to the editable cell topic:
a) If properties like visiblity or editability are changed on IColumn, the accessiblity of editable cells within that column is not calculated anew.
   As consequence, the UI representation of such cells does not correspond to the values on the model.
b) If a value of an editable boolean column is changed by inline editing, other values of that column are toggled/untoggled as well.
   Even though holding the correct value on model, their UI representation differs. For instance, if forcing the UI to refresh by resizing a column, the checked state in UI gets corrected.
c) If toggling three times the very same cell of an editable boolean column, the value is not stored in the model anymore.
d) If toggling a cell of an editable boolean column, it's value is immediately written back to the model which is good.
   This has the effect, that if there is an implict or explicit sort installed on that column, toggled rows are scampering.
   This is especially absurd, if the column is part of an implicit sort, meaning that no CTRL-key was held while determing
   the sort columns. Due to lack of the visual representation of such an implicit sort column, the user gets really confused
   as rows are reorganized for no reason. This problem is also applicable to other types of editable columns.
e) If clicking on a cell of an editable boolean column, the cell transitions into modification state, meaning that the associated cell editor is activated.
   Even though the toggled value is already written back to model, the editor remains open which is confusing to the user.
   This should be changed to immediately close the cell editor if the value is toggled.
f) If an editable colum is moved, the column is not editable anymore. Only if the column is moved back to its origin location, the column becomes editable anymore.
g) If having a checkable table and a cell editor of an editable column does not fill the whole cell space,
   clicking on that empty space toggles the checked state of the row. This is confusing and moreover error-prone as not the row is intended to be checked/unchecked but rather the cell editor activated / toggled.
h) If having a checkable table and moving an editable column to the very first position, a click on that column correctly activates the inline editor.
   Thus, the checked state of that row cannot be changed by clicking on the presented checkbox.
   This should be changed to not allow an editable column to be moved to the first position. Moreorver, the first column should also be freezed if the succeeding column is an editable one.
Solution:
a) Apply row decoration on property change
b) This was because the active cell editor remained active after toggling the value.
   Fixed that a still active cell editor gets closed prior to update the model state.
c) solved by e)
d) Changed that if the value of a cell editor is written back to model, the sort (if applicable) is suspended.
   Thus, even though the column represents an implict or explicit sort column, its values are not sorted anymore which in turn is the expected behavior.
   In consequence, to get the column's values sorted again, the user has to sort the column anew.
e) Instead of creating an ICheckBox as cell editor which stays active until the focus get lost, an empty cell editor (null) is created.
   As the toggled value is immediately written back to the model, this editor gets closed shortly after (see b).
f) Fixed
g) Mouseclicks that are targetted to cell editors are not interpereted as row-check nor row-uncheck clicks anymore.
h) Fixed

Replace current NLS support with Text Provider Services
- added ITextProviderService, IDocumentationTextProviderService, AbstractDynamicNlsTextProviderService
- Migrated existing text providers to scout text provider services
- TEXTS class added for consistent translation retrieval
- Splitted org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared texts into two plugins:
  - org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared contains text provider service with all texts that are used by the runtime
  - org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.legacy.texts.fragment contains all texts that are no longer used by the runtime
- getConfiguredDoc properties moved to different ConfigProperty type for Scout SDK (support for Docs Text Providers)
Migration:
- Add "org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.legacy.texts.fragment" to all products.
- For each existing NLS Class (directly or indirectly extending "org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.ScoutTexts" or "org.eclipse.scout.commons.nls.DynamicNls"):
  - create a new "<YourSharedPlugin>.services.common.text.<Name>TextProviderService" extending "org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.services.common.text.AbstractDynamicNlsTextProviderService" in the corresponding shared plugin.
- For each created TextProvider Service:
  - Overwrite the method "getDynamicNlsBaseName" and return the same value as in the "RESOURCE_BUNDLE_NAME" constant (stored in the corresponding Texts class) as string literal.
  - Register the service in the corresponding plugin as scout service using the "org.eclipse.scout.service.DefaultServiceFactory", no session class and give a ranking > 0. E.g.: <service class="com.bsiag.crm.shared.core.services.common.text.CoreTextProviderService" factory="org.eclipse.scout.service.DefaultServiceFactory" ranking="100" />
- Delete all Texts classes and replace all uses of the old Texts classes with the class "org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared.TEXTS".
- Remove the "getNlsTexts" methods from the Session classes if existent (unless you use session-dependent translations).
- Correct return type of "getConfiguredNlsProvider" of all SqlServices (if existent) to return the new type defined by AbstractSqlService and return "ScoutTexts.class" inside the method.
- If somewhere the "SwingUtility.setNlsTexts" method or "SwtUtility.setNlsTextsOnDisplay" method is used, set it to "ScoutTexts.getInstance()".
- Delete all .nls files (NLS Editor can now be accessed using the TextProviderService Node in the Scout Explorer of the Scout perspective).
  If you want to keep the .nls files (e.g. to support key shortcuts like ctrl+shift+r) do the following:
  - Open the .nls file in the text editor (right click -> open with).
  - Remove the following properties: "Nls-Type", "Nls-File-Prefix", "Nls-Translation-Folder".
  - Change the property "Nls-Class" to the fully qualified name of the Text Provider Service you would like to edit with this .nls file.
  - Save the changes and open the .nls file again in the Multilanguage Editor (right click -> open with).

Bugzilla ticket 361795
Problem:
Decorating a Date or a Number has to use NlsLocale-Settings.
Currently, Locale.getLocal() is used which may contradict with user-settings.
Solution:
In Java 6 it is possible to contribute custom Locales (e.g. en_CH) to the JRE. That is why Scout NlsLocale is not used anymore and therefore marked as deprecated.
The user's locale is accessed as follows:
- On client side, the user's locale is accessed by Locale.getDefault()
- On server side the request's locale is accessed by LocaleThreadLocal.get() (convenience accessor: ServerSession.get().getLocale())
Eventhough the class NlsLocale is marked as deprecated for legacy support, its constructor 'NlsLocale(Locale)' was removed because NlsLocale was changed to only act as delegate to the thread's locale (if applicable) or default locale otherwise.
Please note: A locale consists of its language and country. The country is mainly responsible for format settings as for instance the grouping separator of numbers. A very few locales already exist in the JRE. But if you like to have the application in the English language with Switzerland as its region, you have to contribute your own locale-implementation 'en_CH'. Please see Migration section for detailed instructions to extend JRE with a custom locale.
Plug-Ins changed:
- org.eclipse.scout.commons
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.client
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.server
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.swing
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.oraclelite10g.core
- org.eclipse.scout.rt.xstream.shared
Migration:
- removed NlsLocale(Locale) (constructor): use Locale instead of NlsLocale
- removed IServerSession#getNlsLocale(): use IServerSession#getLocale() instead (e.g. replace all ServerSession.get().getNlsLocale().getLocale() by ServerSession.get().getLocale())
- In client Plug-Ins: replace NlsLocale.getDefault().getLocale() by Locale.getDefault()
- In server Plug-Ins: replace NlsLocale.getThreadDefault().getLocale() by LocaleThreadLocal.get()
- In shared Plug-Ins: replace NlsLocale.getDefault().getLocale() by NlsUtility.getDefaultLocale()
Contribution of custom locales to the JRE:
1. Create a plain Java project, e.g. x.y.localeprovider.en.ch
2. Create two classes that inherit from {@link DateFormatProvider} and {@link NumberFormatProvider} and implement the method stubs specific to your locale
3. Create the folder META-INF/services with two files java.text.spi.DateFormatProvider and java.text.spi.NumberFormatProvider
4. In those files, simply put the the fully qualified name to your date/number provider
5. Export project as JAR file and put it into \lib\ext of your JRE

Problem:
If a checkbox is defined in a sequence box, the label of the checkbox is shown as label of the sequence box although the checkbox itself already shows the label.
Solution:
Excluded BooleanFields from the computation of the compound label.
Migration:
- Since the checkbox is excluded the label of the next field is considered for the compound label.
  So if you use sequenceboxes which contain a checkbox and another field you may want to override execIsLabelSuffixCandidate and return false so that no label suffix is created and only the sequencebox label is shown.

Bugzilla: 369115, Locale on client-side
Locale must be available on the ClientSession and all client jobs have to use it (i.e. set LocaleThreadLocal before executing the job).
Migration:
- Possibly available ClientSession.getLocale and ClientSession.setLocale must either be removed or renamed.
- Dynamically changing the locale must be propagated to the client session as well.
- Accessing a client's locale should always done by invoking LocaleThreadLocal.get()
- ClientJob.run (and therefore ClientSyncJob.run as well as ClientAsyncJob.run) should not be overridden anymore. The method will be marked final in a subsequent release.
  Use ClientJob.runStatus or ClientJob.runVoid instead.

Problem:
When using modes IActivityMap.PLANNING_MODE_DAY or IActivityMap.PLANNING_MODE_WEEK
the selected columns are not handled correctly due to the used values at the end
boundaries of a MinorColumn object. During construction of a MinorColumn, 1ms is
automatically subtracted from the end time.

When fetching the column index for a given end time, it has to be checked if
the given end time fits into the begin and end time interval of the column.
Otherwise, the previous column has to be returned.

Setting up an initial order for IColumns
Problem:
Table columns are initially ordered in the GUI the same way as in the model, using the @Order annotation. It is not

side effect, view orders can be changed after the model has been initialized.

Bugzilla: 374044
Problem:
Currently, table column filters are persisted in user scope preferences. Hence they are reapplied after application
restarts. They are further applied to all table instances having the same client preference context.
Solution:
Table filter settings behave like search form states. i.e. they are remembered as long as a Scout application runs,
but they do not endure application restarts. Reloading pages having search constraints or filters applied, must
apply them again. Memory constraints may limit the size of stored search constraints and filter settings.
Added filter settings cache on IMemoryPolicy.

Bugzilla: 375152
Problem:
When a user cancels the search in an outline, the search form keeps its state but the displayed rows belong to the last
executed search.
Solution:
o If a user cancels the search, all rows in the table should be discarded and the user show be notified of the canceled
  search.
o Additionally, any exception during loading the table data behaves the same: the table data is discarded and
  the table status is set appropriately.
o If the severity of the table population status is IProcessingStatus.CANCEL, the table selection status is hidden and
  the population status is rendered like a warning (e.g. foreground color orange).

Bugzilla: 367850
Problem:
XML I/O on IForm (IForm.storeXML and IForm.loadXML) does not work properly for
IFormFields with a non-unique class name. F.e. if a SearchForm with two tabs
which both contains a TextField with the same class name.
Solution:
o The IFromField provides a method getXMLFieldId() which will be used for XML I/O.
This method will return the fields simple class name by default for fields with unique class names.
For non-unique class names the simple class name of the parent field is added to the id, until it is unique.
o Loading older XML files with ambiguous fields is still possible: Data is imported to the first field found (as before).
