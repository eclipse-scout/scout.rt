   * The creation of a widget requires a parent so that a link between the child and the parent widget (and eventually between all widgets on the desktop) can be established.
   *
   * The parent is typically the same as the {@link owner}, but there may be cases when they (temporarily) diverge:
   * If a widget should temporarily be used by another widget (like a popup), the parent will be changed to that other widget (the popup) but the owner stays the same.
   * This means the popup is now the temporary parent. If the popup is destroyed its children won't be because the popup is not the owner.
   *
   * *Example*: {@link ViewMenuPopup} uses the {@link ViewButton}s as menu items. These view buttons are owned by the desktop and must therefore not be destroyed
   * when the popup closes, otherwise they could not be reused the second time the popup opens.
