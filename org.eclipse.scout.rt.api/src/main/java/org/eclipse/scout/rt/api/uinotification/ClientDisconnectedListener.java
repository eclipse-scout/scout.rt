/**
 * When using HTTP/2, stream cancel errors are propagated but Jersey does not handle them correctly -> asyncResponse still looks valid but cannot be resumed anymore.
 * This means if a client disconnects / aborts the connection, resuming the response will fail and a severe error logged.
 * To prevent that, we need to track the disconnection by ourselves. Another solution would be to disable the stream cancel error propagation in Jetty.
