## The Eclipse Security Team

The Eclipse Security Team provides help and advice to Eclipse projects
on vulnerability issues and is the first point of contact
for handling security vulnerabilities.
Members of the Security Team are committers on Eclipse Projects
and members of the Eclipse Architecture Council.

Contact the [Eclipse Security Team](mailto:security@eclipse.org).

**Note that, as a matter of policy, the security team does not open attachments.**

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should be reported via email to the Eclipse Security Team.

The general security mailing list address is security@eclipse.org.
Members of the Eclipse Security Team will receive messages sent to this address.
This address should be used only for reporting undisclosed vulnerabilities;
regular issue reports and questions unrelated to vulnerabilities in Eclipse software
will be ignored.
Note that this email address is not encrypted.
