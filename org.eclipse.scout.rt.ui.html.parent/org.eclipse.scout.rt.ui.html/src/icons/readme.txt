The iconfont was generated with https://icomoon.io/app/.

To add or remove icons go to the url and import the selection.json-File with the Import Icons button.
To add icons from an existing font (e.g. font awesome) just select the additional icons.
To add custom icons create a svg and upload the icon by using the "Import to Set" button.
The svg should be the same size as the other svg icons in the font and must not have colors (beside black and white)

When creating the font make sure the unicode matches the one in the icon name (for easier maintanance).
