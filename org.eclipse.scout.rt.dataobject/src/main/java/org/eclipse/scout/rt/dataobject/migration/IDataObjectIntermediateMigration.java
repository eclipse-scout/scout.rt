/**
 * For a {@link IDoStructureMigrationHandler} or a {@link IDoValueMigrationHandler} the migration handler is called for
 * a matching data object when visited recursively. In contrast, an intermediate migration is called once for the data
 * object provided to any of the migrate data object methods within {@link DataObjectMigrator}. It's called after
 * structure migration was applied but before value migration is applied. This enables an implementation to modify the
 * data object so that value migration can be applied correctly.
 * <p>
 * There is no support for a kind of migration that is called before the structure migration or after the value
 * migration because a caller of {@link DataObjectMigrator} is able to do that by itself.
 * <p>
 * Different intermediate migrations must not interfere with each other. The execution order is based on the order they
 * are added to {@link DataObjectIntermediateMigrationContextData#add(IDataObjectIntermediateMigration)} and in the
 * order local intermediate migrations are provided as argument to a migrate data object method within
 * {@link DataObjectMigrator}.
