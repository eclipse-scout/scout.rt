/**
 * This producers creates always a new instance for the given bean. It is used as default producer except for the ones
 * annotated with {@link ApplicationScoped}.

 * Instances returned are created and fully initialized with respect to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Annotation {@link InjectBean} on constructor parameters
 * <li>Annotation {@link InjectBean} on class fields
 * <li>Annotation {@link InjectBean} on initializer methods parameters
 * <li>Annotation {@link PostConstruct} on initializer methods

 * This class is thread safe. Concurrent invocations of {@link #produce(IBean)} create multiple instances.

 * <b>Important:</b> Beans are discarded without any clean-up operations if the creation process throws any exception.
 * The implementer of a bean's constructor and its {@link PostConstruct}-annotated methods is responsible for proper
 * disposal of already bound resources.
