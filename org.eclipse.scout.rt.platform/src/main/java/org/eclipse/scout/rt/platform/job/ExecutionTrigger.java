/**
 * Component that defines the schedule upon which a job will commence execution.
 * <p>
 * A trigger can be as simple as a 'one-shot' execution at some specific point in time in the future, or represent a
 * schedule which executes a job on a repeatedly basis. The latter can be configured to run infinitely, or to end at a
 * specific point in time. It is further possible to define rather complex triggers, like to execute a job every second
 * Friday at noon, but with the exclusion of all the business's holidays.
 * <p>
 * See the various schedule builders provided by Quartz Scheduler:<br>
 * {@link SimpleScheduleBuilder}, {@link CronScheduleBuilder}, {@link CalendarIntervalScheduleBuilder},
 * {@link DailyTimeIntervalScheduleBuilder}.
 * <p>
 * The most powerful builder is {@link CronScheduleBuilder}. Cron is a UNIX tool with powerful and proven scheduling
 * capabilities.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, Scout provides you with {@link FixedDelayScheduleBuilder} to run a job with a fixed delay between the
 * termination of one execution and the commencement of the next execution.
 *
 * @see TriggerBuilder
 * @since 5.2
