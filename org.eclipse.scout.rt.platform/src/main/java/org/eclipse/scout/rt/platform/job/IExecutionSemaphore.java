/**
 * Represents a fair counting semaphore used in Job API to control the maximal number of jobs running concurrently.
 * <p>
 * Jobs which are assigned to the same semaphore run concurrently until they reach the maximal concurrency level defined
 * for that semaphore. Subsequent tasks then wait in the queue until a permit becomes available.
 * <p>
 * A semaphore initialized to <code>one</code> allows to run jobs in a mutually exclusive manner, and a semaphore
 * initialized to <code>zero</code> to run no job at all. The number of total permits available can be changed at any
 * time, which allows to adapt the maximal concurrency level to some dynamic criteria like time of day or system load.
 * However, once calling {@link #seal()}, the number of permits cannot be changed anymore, and any attempts will result
 * in an {@link AssertionException}.
 * <p>
 * By default, this semaphore is unbounded.
