/**
 * Helper class to schedule jobs that optionally run on behalf of a {@link RunContext}. This class is for convenience
 * purpose to facilitate the creation and scheduling of jobs.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Jobs.schedule(new IRunnable() {
 *
 *   &#64;Override
 *   public void run() throws Exception {
 *     // do something
 *   }
 * }, Jobs.newInput()
 *      .withName("example job")
 *      .withRunContext(RunContexts.copyCurrent()
 *          .withSubject(...)
 *          .withLocale(Locale.US))
 *      .withExecutionTrigger(Jobs.newExecutionTrigger()
 *          .withStartIn(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
 *          .withSchedule(FixedDelayScheduleBuilder.repeatForever(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)));
 * </pre>
 *
 * The following code snippet illustrates how the job is finally run:
 *
 * <pre>
 * BEANS.get(IJobManager.class).schedule(new IRunnable() {
 *
 *   &#64;Override
 *   public void run() throws Exception {
 *     runContext.run(new IRunnable() {
 *
 *       &#064;Override
 *       public void run() throws Exception {
 *         // do some work
 *       }
 *     });
 *   }
 * });
 * </pre>
 *

 * @see IJobManager
 * @see RunContext

   * immediately at the next reasonable opportunity. In either case, the submitter of the job continues to run in
   * parallel.
   * <p>
   * If the maximal concurrency level for a semaphore aware job is reached, the job is queued until a permit becomes
   * available. As a general rule, jobs compete for an execution permit once being fired by the associated trigger, and
   * in the order as being scheduled. For example, if scheduling two jobs in a row, they very likely will have the same
