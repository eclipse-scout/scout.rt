/**
 * All classes marked with this annotation (or an annotation that has this annotation) are automatically registered in
 * the scout {@link IBeanManager}
 * <p>
 * see also {@link Order}, {@link ApplicationScoped} and annotations qualified with {@link BeanInvocationHint}
 * <p>
 * The existence of the file <code>META-INF/scout.xml</code> will make scout add all relevant beans in this maven module
 * with {@link IBeanManager#registerClass(Class)}. <br>
 * These includes classes that satisfy all of the following rules:
 * <ol>
 * <li>class is public or protected</li>
 * <li>class is top level or static inner type</li>
 * <li>class has annotation {@link Bean} (directly or indirectly by on of its super classes or interfaces) or an
 * annotation that itself has the qualifier {@link Bean} (such as {@link ApplicationScoped})</li>
 * <li>class is not directly annotated with {@link IgnoreBean}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <h2>Important feature of scout bean handling</h2> When dealing with re-use of code and custom code that changes
 * existing behavior, the java <code>extends</code> keyword does not distinguish between <b>REPLACE</b> and
 * <b>RE-USE</b> of code. For example there may be a <code>PersonForm</code> and a
 * <code>VipPersonForm extends PersonForm</code>. Both of them are required at runtime. One is just more specialized and
 * handles special persons. So {@link BEANS#get(Class)} of PersonForm.class should yield an instance of PersonForm
 * whereas {@link BEANS#get(Class)} of VipPersonForm.class should yield an instance of VipPersonForm.
 * <p>
 * On the other hand consider the case of <code>PersonForm</code> and <code>PersonFormEx extends PersonForm</code> with
 * the goal of replacing the former PersonForm. Here {@link BEANS#get(Class)} of PersonForm.class should yield an
 * instance of PersonFormEx and also {@link BEANS#get(Class)} of PersonFormEx.class should yield an instance of
 * PersonFormEx.
 * <p>
 * How could the {@link IBeanManager} know which is the case?
 * <p>
 * Here the {@link Replace} annotations enters the stage: The class
 * <code>@Bean @Replace public class PersonFormEx extends PersonForm{...}</code> has the additional {@link Replace}
 * annotation to express the semantics of replacing PersonForm. With that annotation {@link IBeanManager} eliminates the
 * subclassed class and only retains the new subclassing class as runtime.
 * <p>
 * Without that annotation {@link IBeanManager} considers both the subclassed and the subclassing class as two beans
 * that are available at runtime.
