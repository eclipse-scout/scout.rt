/**
 * This class provides functionality to execute Runnables some time in the future on behalf of a
 * {@link ThreadPoolExecutor}. Thereto, this executor schedules a 'Dispatch-Loop-Runnable' to wait for expired Runnables
 * to be executed.
 * <p>
 * This class is necessary because {@link ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} is not applicable for {@link JobManager} due to
 * its fixed-size thread pool. That means, that once the <code>core-pool-size</code> is exceeded, the creation of
 * on-demand threads up to a <code>maximum-pool-size</code> would not be supported.
 * <p>
 * Also, this executor is used over Quartz Scheduler because of its better performance when having more than 10'000 jobs
 * running simultaneously.
