 * Class implementing a dynamic list of synchronizer groups.

 * A group is identified by a key. For each key a lock object is created on first use of the key. Tasks that belong to
 * equal keys are never executed in parallel. Tasks that belong to different keys may run at the same time. Therefore
 * the key object must implement hashCode() & equals() methods.
 * <p>
 * No entries are removed automatically. It is important to remove a group as soon as it is no longer required to
 * prevent memory leaks.
